Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of data (either 0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. Additionally, the phenomenon of entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in such a way that the state of one (whether it's 0 or 1) can depend on the state of another, even over long distances. These features enable quantum computers to potentially solve complex problems much more efficiently than classical computers.\n\nOne notable player in this field is IBM, which provides access to quantum computing resources through its IBM Quantum platform.

This technology holds promise for solving certain types of problems much more efficiently than conventional computers, particularly in fields like cryptography, optimization, and simulation."
